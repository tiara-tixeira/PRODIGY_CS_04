# Simple Keylogger

Overview
This project implements a basic keylogger in Python that captures keystrokes and logs them to a file. The Simple Keylogger demonstrates fundamental concepts of keyboard monitoring and is intended for educational purposes only. It is crucial to use this tool responsibly and only on systems where you have explicit permission.

Features
Keystroke Logging: Captures and records keystrokes in real-time.
Log File: Saves captured keystrokes to a text file for review.
Basic Functionality: Provides a simple implementation of keylogging for educational purposes.
How It Works
The Simple Keylogger uses a Python library to monitor keyboard events and logs each keystroke to a specified file. It runs in the background, capturing keystrokes as they occur.
